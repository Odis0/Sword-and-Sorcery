This is my original code for initializing the world.

        /*
        Room throneRoom = new Room("Throne Room", "A luxurious throne room.", 0, 0);
        Room armory = new Room("Armory", "An array of weapons and armor line the shelves.", 0, 1);
        Room bobcatRoom = new Room("Bobcat Room", "The decor of this room is distinctly bobcat themed, using many of the cats' pelts.", 0, 2);




        Character conan = new Character("Conan", "A brutish looking man, with a wise twinkle in his eye.", 0, 0);
        GameObject[] gameObjectsList =
        {
                //Rooms
                throneRoom,
                armory,
                bobcatRoom,
                //Characters
                conan
            };



        GameWorld gameWorld = new GameWorld(5,5);
        foreach (GameObject i in gameObjectsList)
        {
            gameWorld.worldArray[i.xLocation, i.yLocation].Add(i);
        }
        */
